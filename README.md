# Bridge-Hiker-Problems
Problem description:
1. Narrow bridge can hold 2 people at a time
2. Hikers has 1 torch which need to be used to cross bridge at night time
3. Hikers speed of walking are different. So, when two hikers cross the bridge together, they must move at slower personâ€™s pace.
4. At each bridge, they will meet another team of hikers who need helps from earlier team of hikers.

YAML file input:
1. Number of Bridges
2. Length of each bridge
2. Speed of each Hikers ft/min
3. The Solution should assume any number of people and bridges

Solutions for:
1. Determine fastest time that the hikers can cross each bridge.
2. Total time of crossings of all bridges.

The checkin files:
1. Architecture and design diagram (UML): BridgeHikerArchandDesignDiagram.pdf 
2. Detail explanation of design: BridgeHikerDesignNote.docx
3. Makefile to build the project
4. Input config file: BridgeHikerConfig.yaml
5. C++ class definition: BridgeCrossing.h
6. C++ class implementation: BridgeCrossing.cpp
7. yaml parser and driver code: BridgeCrossDriver.cpp
